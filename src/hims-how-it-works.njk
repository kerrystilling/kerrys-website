                <p class="w:100p relative font:lg leading:160">
                    Before this project, I was developing pages for Hims using Webflow. To enhance Webflow’s built-in interactions, I frequently added custom JavaScript for additional customization. However, implementing custom JavaScript in Webflow required manual deployments to view changes. Moreover, the built-in Webflow interactions couldn’t achieve the specific effects the team wanted.

                <h3 class="w:100p relative font:lg leading:160 mb:16 font:4xl medium leading:100 tighter">The approach</h3>
                <p class="w:100p relative font:lg leading:160">
                    As a result, I decided to build this page from scratch using code and a code editor. For tools, I used Eleventy as a static site generator, Nunjucks for templating, GSAP for animations, and UniformCSS as a utility framework. This setup allowed for hot reloading and instant previews. To facilitate collaboration between design and engineering, I chose Netlify for hosting, which provided deploy/branch previews for iterative development.

                <p class="w:100p relative font:lg leading:160">
                    Beyond the technical aspect, I had to transform a highly ambitious design into a practical, performant, and responsive experience.<br><br>The initial designs were full of big ideas, fueled by the excitement surrounding the project. The team envisioned captivating ways to illustrate each step of the patient journey with Hims. However, some of these ideas couldn't be fully visualized in Figma.

                <p class="w:100p relative font:lg leading:160">
                    By adopting this new workflow, I unlocked efficiencies and enabled better collaboration with the design team. On this page, I was tasked with implementing features not used in other Hims digital touchpoints. For example, how could we tie 3D animation to scrolling? This was new territory for us, but by using GSAP and sprites, I managed to keep the page performant while achieving the desired effect.<br><br>In many instances, the page was being designed on the fly during development. Thanks to the workflow I chose, I could iterate fast and come up with animations and designs more quickly than prototyping in Figma. This flexibility was crucial, allowing me to work efficiently within the tight timeline that couldn't be met using Hims' current development procedures. Working at this pace, the bottle neck went from engineering to design and 3D modeling.

                <p class="w:100p relative font:lg leading:160">
                    The number of stakeholders involved made feedback cycles quite complex, as there was significant interest in the project. Additionally, because this was a non-revenue-producing page focused on storytelling, the strategy was more subjective than usual. Throughout the process, I did my best to listen to my teammates' input and take action when it made sense. One downside of the rapid work and iteration was that it was challenging to bring things to a point of completion when so much was possible.
